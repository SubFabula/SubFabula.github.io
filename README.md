## Welcome

Welcome to my Main-Home site!

In this place, I learn how to code with both HTML and other types of Coding Languages like CSS. For now, there is only the TestGround and the other project I'm working on. Feel free to take a look at them. Also the reason im calling this place Main-Home Site/Page is because there is jsut going to be SO MANY other sites that imma work on an they will have their own Home Page. So calling this place the Main-Home Page/Site like its the Master rep. or smt like that.
